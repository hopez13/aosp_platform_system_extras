      "message": "removed. The member functions in EventSelection and EventSelectionSet all contain one loop, I think separating them can make things more clear. You don\u0027t need to mix the fact that we are operating on multiple event types, and how to operate on one event type. As we add functions, I think EventSelection may become more complex, so it\u0027s better wait to see.",
