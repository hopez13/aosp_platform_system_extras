Making this type of change would be good even without the former.\n- I like to point out my huge impact!\n- I used the same commit message (template) for many CLs, and not every reviewer is aware of the implications of making a library shared-\u003estatic. For some of them, I moved additional libraries to being shared as well (that were static for no reason). Hopefully, the people with more curiosity will even take it on themselves to think a little harder about this static/shared decision. :(",
