Either that, or sort right before use so you can avoid having to incur the cost of this sort until you actually need to use it. That would also avoid needing to recreate the list every time.",

      "message": "Why? Also, on arm 32, you aren\u0027t guaranteed to end this way, but most of the time you should.\n\nI\u0027m trying to find a way to fix arm so we won\u0027t unwind too far, but I don\u0027t have a good solution yet. If you want to see a frame like this, do a debuggerd -b \u003cmedia.codec\u003e that usually winds up with one or two frames past __libc_init. This should only apply for threads ending in __libc_init, you can\u0027t go beyond __start_thread any more, but you could in the past.\n\nAn alternate solution would be to mark a stack frame where you saw __libc_init or __start_thread, and omit that way. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s very easy though.",
