      "message": "Are these \"int\" to prevent a bunch of churn to thread_tree? In quite a few places, these end up getting cast to uint32_t as well. I\u0027ll also note that these get printed as %d, which is maybe not helpful in the case where it is actually a negative integer value (although maybe that doesn\u0027t happen in practice).",

      "message": "Unfortunately, simpleperf uses three different types for pids/tids:\n  pid_t: normal type to define a thread id on linux.\n  int: on linux, pid_t is really int on linux.\n  uint32_t: used in records dumped from the kernel, like https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h#L715.\n\nI tried to use pid_t as much as possible. But I met a problem when trying to use pid_t here:\non windows clang defines pid_t as long long, and need %lld to print it, but on linux it\u0027s %d.\nSo I just used int here.\nBut now I think I can use pid_t here, and static_cast to int when printing it.",
