As in the comment, it precludes running the code as part of a standalone executable. This problem only happens when running in app\u0027s context, native tests (like bionic tests) running in shell context are fine. \n\nIf you think there is a need to fix this, I can send a patch to upstream: the easiest change might be asking gtest-port.cc to try $TMPDIR after failing to access /sdcard, and user code can change $TMPDIR.",
