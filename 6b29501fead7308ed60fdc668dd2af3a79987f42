      "message": "Added documentation and state machine diagrams.\n\nFor the record, I disagree with \"more broken than not\". This provides reasonable semantics in a (given the constraints) relatively simple implementation. IMO falling back to default if the user choice had been overridden for a potentially long time is reasonable, and is easier to represent in a UI. Otherwise, the UI would have to distinguish between \"OFF\" and \"OFF but you asked for ON\".",
