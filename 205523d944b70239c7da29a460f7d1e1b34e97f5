I just invented a location in system/extras for this, but I\u0027ve no strong opinions on where this should go.\n\nI\u0027m moving it here from system/core though, for the very pragmatic reason that it has a PREUPLOAD.cfg that imposes a clang-format upload check, which I\u0027d rather avoid for these files that should be copies of the ones in the ART tree (there doesn\u0027t seem to be a convenient way to disable that check in a subtree).\n\nI regard this as a short-term solution, where the long-term goal is to improve the tooling so that the NDK API can be vetted upstream in the unbundled ART branches and the ndk_{library,headers} modules reference them from prebuilt drops of ART (cf. http://b/164126569#comment16).",
