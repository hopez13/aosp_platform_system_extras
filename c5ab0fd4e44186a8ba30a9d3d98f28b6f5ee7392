      "message": "Okay, after a little searching, it appears that these macros are related to a tool called sparse designed to find problems in the kernel.\n\nI think that someone copied some of this code into a header file incorrectly, and it has been propagated all over the place. They were probably trying to indicate that if the __CHECKER__ is defined, do not compile this module with the sparse stuff enabled.\n\nSome of the external projects have a #ifdef __CHECKER__ that appears to be trying to enable this sparse stuff if defined. But again that looks incorrect and I think we can remove this completely. When I go to fix the external projects, I\u0027ll see if they have any mode that defines __CHECKER__.",
