      "message": "I could, but that doesn\u0027t solve the problem that frameworks/base isn\u0027t available in all branches.\n\nDan suggested moving the dropbox code. Joe suggested moving perfprofd into frameworks/base. Neither is great.\n\nSo right now I consider this similar to the simpleperf symbolizer CL - just make progress, clean up when it\u0027s clear what the \"right\" (\u003dsomething everyone can agree on) solution is, and hope that things don\u0027t diverge (which is unlikely).",

      "message": "yeah, moving the dropbox code makes sense to me. certainly sounds better than having two copies. it can be in system/core/ but still have the same OWNERS it had in frameworks/base/...\n\nperfprofd in frameworks/base/ sounds like both a layering violation *and* making one of our most problematically over-sized git projects even worse!",
