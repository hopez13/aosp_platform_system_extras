      "message": "I think it makes sense to move this into ext4_fill_in_sb.  It was originally here because it might memcpy sb into the middle of a block, so it has to be done after all changes to sb, but I think it makes more sense to queue the block up front and have aux_info.sb be a pointer into the middle of the block.",
