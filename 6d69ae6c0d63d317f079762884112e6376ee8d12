      "message": "This doesn\u0027t seem like a very robust way of doing things (e.g. it\u0027ll fail if you have an app with a dumb but allowed package name, like \u0027libc.so\u0027). Looking for an apk in /proc/\u003cpid\u003e/fd might be better?\n\nAlso, does this actually work for apps on the system partition? \"grep com.android.calendar /proc/`pidof com.android.calendar`/maps\" is empty on AOSP hikey960 for me.",

      "message": "Thanks for reminding me. It doesn\u0027t work for apps on system partition, which have dir different from their package name. Just checking apk file isn\u0027t enough, because zygote has an opened apk file (/system/framework/framework-res.apk). So I changed to check if there is an apk file from an app dir (like /data/app, or /system/app, or /vendor/app).",
