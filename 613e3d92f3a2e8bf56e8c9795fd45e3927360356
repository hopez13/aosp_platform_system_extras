      "message": "Hi there!\n\nI\u0027ve been trying to use simpleperf on Android to profile Chromium and specifically the V8 JS engine. And, coming from linux, I was missing symbolization of jitted functions. I realized that V8\u0027s `--perf-basic-prof` option which generates `perf-\u003cpid\u003e.map` files didn\u0027t quite work, and I couldn\u0027t fix it without changing simpleperf itself. \n\nEssentially, this is about allowing spaces in symbols, which may sound surprising, but is actually done a lot in V8. It also brings simpleperf\u0027s behaviour closer to that of linux\u0027s perf.\n\nYou can find more details here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id\u003d13987\n\nWDYT? \n\nThis is my first contribution to Android, hopefully I have the process right!\n\nThanks,\nPierre",
