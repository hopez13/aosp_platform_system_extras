      "message": "In the previous version, simpleperf would only dig into the contents of an APK file if there was actually a sample attributed to some MMAP\u0027d section in the APK. Now it looks as though it opens/inspects the APK as soon as it sees the MMAP record...  could this increase overhead?  I don\u0027t know enough about how the kernel PMU stuff works here -- if the kernel is only reporting MMAPs for things that have samples, then it would not be an issue.",

      "message": "I think it is the same as before. Previously we checked Apk file for each MmapRecord, as ProcessRecord-\u003eCollectHitFileInfo-\u003eTestForEmbeddedElf. The kernel reports mmaps whenever there is a do_mmap() syscall. I think we can keep current simple logic unless there is a real need to optimize this.",
