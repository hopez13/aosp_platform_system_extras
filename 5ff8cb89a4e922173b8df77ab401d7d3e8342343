Whether simpleperf supports profiling on the Android emulator has been asked by android studio folks and Quddus Chong, who is writing ndk document for simpleperf. I guess people outside google might also be curious. And since simpleperf supports that, why don\u0027t we document it clearly, so people can take most of the Android emulator.",

(especially if you don\u0027t already understand the difference between hardware and software events, and the trade-offs there.)\n\ni just don\u0027t believe this is something real people should be doing.\n\n\"when an Android device is not available\" should be basically zero developers: developing an Android app without a device is crazy. and \"you need to be root\" is already solved; you don\u0027t need to be root.\n\nthere\u0027s already a place for helping people shoot themselves in the foot: it\u0027s called stackoverflow.com.",
