      "message": "It is because the monitored thread was switched from cpu A to cpu B, it has one sample in cpu A and one sample in cpu B, but the sample in cpu B was dumped before the sample in cpu A. The reason is simpleperf reads samples in cpu A before cpu B.\nI think it doesn\u0027t matter, because it rarely happens, and will be less likely to happen after using record reading thread in the future.",
