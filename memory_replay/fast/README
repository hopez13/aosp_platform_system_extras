The files in this directory are an alternative implementation of the memory_replay tool in the
parent directory, targeting performance at the cost of requiring a preprocessing step for each
replay. memreplay_fast will do the preprocessing on demand if passed a text dump. Alternatively,
a set of pre-preprocessed dumps is stored in dumps.

The preprocessor scans the memory replay for when pointers are freed or realloced in threads other
than the ones that allocated them. Prior to each point of exchange, a sync point between the two
threads is inserted. Global sync points are inserted for when threads enter and exit, and on a
regular interval to print the current state of the process. This allows the runner to do work on
multiple threads at once and synchronize when it needs to, instead of the original implementation of
serializating actions on each thread. The preprocessor also writes the replay into a format that
does not require parsing in the runner. The combination of these two optimizations results in
performance that is 8-15x faster than the original implementation, at the cost of a relatively cheap
one-time preprocessing step.
