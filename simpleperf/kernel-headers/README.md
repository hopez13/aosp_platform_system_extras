This directory contains the perf related cleaned kernel headers.

The headers are slightly different from the cleaned headers in the bionic
kernel directory (bionic/libc/kernel/uapi):

- All include files are removed from the headers.
- The enum perf_event_arm_regs in asm-arm64/perf_regs.h was renamed to
  be perf_events_arm64_regs to avoid conflicting with the same named
  enum in asm-arm/perf_regs.h

The cleaned headers are generated by a script, the details of which can be
found in:

  bionic/libc/kernel/README.TXT

These files allow the compilation of simpleperf on host or target without
the need to include the files from the bionic kernel header directory.

The perf structures and values remain relatively stable, so this should not
require updating for every new kernel version.
