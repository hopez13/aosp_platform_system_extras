I guess the \u0027most correct\u0027 way would be to pass a ScopedTempFiles object to everything that would call CreateTempFile() and have these all be instance functions/variables, but I\u0027m not sure if that would be too much of a hassle.\n\nThe rest of the this looks good to me; I\u0027m glad the TemporaryFiles are back to fully managed pointers.",
