# libatrace_rust benchmarks

Benchmarks to compare the performance of Rust ATrace bindings with directly calling the
`libcutils` methods from C++.

There are two binaries implementing the same benchmarks:

* `libatrace_rust_benchmark` (`atrace_benchmark.rs`) for Rust.
* `libatrace_rust_benchmark_cc` (`atrace_benchmark.cc`) for C++.

The benchmarks emit ATrace events with tracing off and tracing on. `atrace_begin` is measured
with short and long event names to check if the string length affects timings. For example,
`tracing_on_begin/1000` measures `atrace_begin` with a 1000-character name and tracing enabled.

## Running the benchmarks

To run the benchmarks, push the binaries to the device with `adb` and launch them via `adb shell`.
You may need to push dynamic libraries they depend on as well if they're not present on device and
run with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Do not enable ATrace collectors. The benchmarks effectively emit events in a loop and will spam
any trace and distort performance results.

The benchmarks will override system properties to enable or disable events, specifically ATrace App
event collection in `debug.atrace.app_number` and `debug.atrace.app_0`. After a successful execution
the events will be disabled.

## Results

The timings are not representative of actual cost of fully enabling tracing, only of emitting
events via API, since there's nothing receiving the events.

The tests were done on a `aosp_cf_x86_64_phone-userdebug` Cuttlefish VM. Execution times on real
device may be different but we expect similar relative performance between Rust wrappers and C.

*If you notice that measurements with tracing off and tracing on have similar times, it might mean
that enabling ATrace events failed and you need to debug the benchmark.*
