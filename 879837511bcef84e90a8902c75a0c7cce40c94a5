      "message": "Yes, we could. But this happens quite rarely (so performance is not an issue), and this way we can avoid a special case for the boot up case by reusing that. I don\u0027t think it makes much of a difference either way; I also drafted a change where we pass in the property name always, and I slightly preferred the current approach.",
