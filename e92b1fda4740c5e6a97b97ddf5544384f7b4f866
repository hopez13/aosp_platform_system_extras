      "message": "In this branch, nothing uses this variable at all, since we don\u0027t have the new cts build infrastructure. I believe all the N+ branches (which have the infrastructure) only take cts now.\n\nSo that should probably be a separate change, since AFAIK, it\u0027ll enable this test in CTS, where it\u0027s been disabled since they swapped from cts_v2 to cts. I guess it wouldn\u0027t hurt to make that change in this branch, but if you want it to happen in N, it should be made in that branch.",
